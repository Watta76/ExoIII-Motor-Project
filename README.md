# ExoIII-Motor-Project
Programming scripts for ExoIII Motor Project data analysis pipeline

This repository contains the full data analysis workflow used to process, filter, and analyze single-particle trajectories of Exonuclease III–powered rolling DNA motors. The pipeline supports all datasets included in the accompanying manuscript, including motor optimization experiments, fluorophore and sequence tuning, surface-density studies, and motion-based biosensing assays.

The codebase is written in Python and designed to run in Google Colab, and can be run in Jupyter/Colab or a standard local Python environment with minor modifications. The changepoint algorithm codebase is written in MATLAB and designed to run in its respective software.
